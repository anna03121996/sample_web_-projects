            <h1>About Us</h1><br><br>
        <p style="color: black;">
            Web D School has been operational from the year 2014 & we have been conduction course like UX UI Designing, Web Designing, Digital Marketing, Android app development, Editing, VFX & Animation. Through the years, our main focus had been in the classroom training, but we had beeb offering online course too, all these years, to those students who reside outside Chennai.
            <br><br>
            But now, our focus on the online classes model has increased multifold, because of which we have completely revamped our training methodology, curriculum, knowledge sharing system etc.
            <br><br>
            We, Web D School, have gained immense reputation as the best training institute in the region, & more than 2000 past students would bear testimony to that fact.
            <br><br>
            We sish to get the same reputation in the online classroom space as well - to be known as the best in the online training business. And we are the right track to achive theat as well very shortly.

            <h1>Core Value Of Web D School</h1>
            <p>
                We understand that we have enormous responsibility towards our students in helping 
                <br> them realize their dreams; so, we are always in the lookout for ways to share maximum knowledge with them.
                <br><br>
                We have never considered this training field as ‘Just another business to make money’, 
                <br> as we know that it’s much more than that. Teaching is a noble deed, &amp; we strive very hard to protect the sacredness surrounding that deed.
                <br><br>
                Education is the most potent tool for empowering people, &amp; this notion would reflect 
                <br> in all our steps throughout the training program.
                <br><br>
                Lastly, we like to keep things simple. We neither offer 10+ certifications nor have any associations with fancy names 
                <br> from the industry. But we know what is necessary for the aspiring students to start a solid career in their chosen field. And we offer only that.
